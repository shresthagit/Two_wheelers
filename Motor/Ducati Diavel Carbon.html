<div class="second"><h1>Ducati Diavel Overview</h1><p class="a">
Ducati entered the cruiser segment with the Diavel in 2009 with the bike making its India debut, two years later. Since then, Ducati has kept on updating it with a few series versions like the Diavel Diesel and the Diavel Carbon. However, with the unveiling of the Diavel 1260 at EICMA 2018 (more info on the Diavel 1260 here), it is the end of the road for the Diavel. That should not be disheartening in case you wanted the Diavel as several Ducati dealers across India will be selling the motorcycle well into the second quarter of this year. Expect a few to offer some serious price discounts or give away free accessories with the motorcycle.</p><br><br>
