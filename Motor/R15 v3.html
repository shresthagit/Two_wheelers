	<h1>Dual channel ABS</h1><p class="a">
Enjoy great performance now with superior control. YZF R15 V 3.0 now comes with a dual-channel ABS, which means precise braking even when the bike is speeding up, without any wheel lock-ups. This ensures a confident inspiring ride and let the rider enjoy the ride to the fullest.</p><br><br>
<h1>155cc LC4V SOHC Fuel Injection Engine</h1><p class="b">
The YZF-R15 mounts a new 155cc liquid-cooled SOHC 4-valve fuel-injected engine to achieve excellent power and a high top speed. The engine has a 58.0 — 58.7 mm bore — stroke and a 11.6:1 compression ratio, and produces a maximum 14.2 kW (19.3 PS) of power at 10,000 rpm and a maximum 15 N-m (1.49 kgf-m) of torque at 8,500 rpm.</p><br><br>
<h1>Assist & Slipper Clutch</h1><p class="c">
An A&S (assist and slipper) clutch is adopted to reduce the weight of the clutch pull and provide low-stress shifting during deceleration. The A&S helps to reduce fatigue for the rider. This also prevents excessive engine braking, thus reducing its effects on chassis behavior. The A&S clutch makes for smooth, enjoyable downshifts.</p><br><br>
<h1>6 Speed Transmission</h1><p class="d">
Allows better acceleration even in low gears for a true R experience.</p><br><br>
<h1>Aerodynamic LED Tail And Headlight</h1><p class="e">
A sharper design that assists in overall airflow with efficient lighting and also includes a hazard lamp and slim twin- eye led headlights.</p><br><br>
<h1>Super Wide Tyre</h1><p class="f">
Super wide tire (Front: 100 / 80-17, Rear: 140mm/70 -17) presents the stability of driving 140mm size rear tire aimed at improved rear grip.</p><br><br>
